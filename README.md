Credit Scoring Model

A credit scoring model is a statistical tool used by financial institutions which have became an essential tools in modern finance, playing a crucial role in lending decisions, risk management, and financial inclusion, is used for both checking whether to give a loan to a customer and determining if the customer is worth taking the loan. In other words we can say as A credit scoring model is a tool to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.
Coming to the technical terms, We can consider this as a classification problem which is a type of supervised machine learning problem and can be build using any of the classification models.Here I have used the Logistic regression model of scikit-learn library.Here are the steps to build the Credit scoring model :-

Step - 1 : Collecting the dataset from the Kaggle.

Step - 2 : Importing the libraries required.

Step - 3 : Pre-processing of data.
           i) Removing the null values
           ii) Removing the extra characters in the features of the dataset and converting them into appropriate form
           
Step - 4 : Splitting the data into training data and testing data.

Step - 5 : Loading the machine learning model and fitting the data to the model.

Step - 6 : Evaluating the model and Predicting.

Step - 7 : Computing of the accuracy score.
